## Problem: 
web2py has Windows binaries made with py2exe and later with bbfreeze (see Niphlod's page on http://www.web2pyslices.com/slice/show/1726/build-windows-binaries). Unfortunately, while web2py nowadays runs fine with pyhton 3.5+ these build tools are not currently compatible with python >= 3.5.  
Hence I've started to look for alternatives, and after some work I've succeeded to gain 64 bit binaries using Pyinstaller.
