## Problem: 
web2py has Windows and Macintosh binaries made with py2exe and later with bbfreeze (see Niphlod's page on http://www.web2pyslices.com/slice/show/1726/build-windows-binaries). Unfortunately, while web2py nowadays runs fine with pyhton 3.5+ these build tools are not currently compatible with python >= 3.5.  
Hence I've started to look for alternatives, and after some work I've succeeded to gain 64 bit binaries using Pyinstaller.

Here you can find the experimental binary for MacOs and Windows, build by me with python 3.7.

If you prefer to build them by yourself, see the specific README for Windows (https://github.com/nicozanf/web2py-pyinstaller/blob/master/README_win.md) and for Mac (https://github.com/nicozanf/web2py-pyinstaller/blob/master/README_mac.md)
